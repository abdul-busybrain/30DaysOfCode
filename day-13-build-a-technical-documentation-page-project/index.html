        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>

        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>

        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
        <header>Hello world</header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p>

        <code
          >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can declare a variable in three ways: With the keyword var. For
          example,
        </p>

        <code>var x = 42</code>

        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
<br>
By simply assigning it a value. For example,
        </p>
        <code>x = 42</code>

        <p>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
<br>
With the keyword let. For example,
        </p>
        <code>let y = 13</code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
        <header>if else statement</header>
        <p>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        </p>

        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        
        <p>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
      </section>
